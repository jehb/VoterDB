# Tar Heel Voters

Many, many times through the years I've created various little code snippets to work with voter registration and history data as provided by the North Carolina Board of Elections. Most of the time, that code has been awful looking and I wouldn't wish it upon anyone. But here exists a repository so that perhaps in the future, as I continue to make awful code, I can at least stop rewriting it.
